== README

Currently this is a personal blog project to teach myself Rails.

Details:

* Developed in Rails v 4.1
* Includes a blog with comments, user management and encrypted authentication using BCrypt.
  - Blog now contains syntax highlighting via the {CodeRay}[http://coderay.rubychan.de/] gem
* Includes a Mailer to alert me when someone is interested in contacting me

Will be adding onto the project and the README as more functionality gets added!
